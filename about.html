      <h2>About IPIA</h2>
      <p>
        The International Politics in Africa (IPIA) research network is a group of scholars and practitioners
        engaged in the empirical study and understanding of how African societies, citizens, governments,
        supranational institutions, and non-governmental organisations experience international politics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Members of IPIA work on a wide range of themes, including but not limited to: foreign policy, diplomacy,
        peace and security, regional integration, international organisations, development cooperation, migration,
        climate politics, and the everyday practices through which African actors engage global power.
      </p>
      <p>
        On this website, you can learn more about our activities, explore current and past events, and connect
        with our members across different disciplines and regions.

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>
        We meet regularly via a monthly virtual seminar, and at workshops and conferences around the globe.
        These meetings provide a space to share work in progress, discuss new research, and reflect on how
        international politics is experienced and practised in different African contexts.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the group is not institutionally affiliated, we work closely with institutional partners such as
        the British Institute in Eastern Africa (BIEA) and CORN West Africa, among others. Collaborations with
        partners support joint events, writing workshops, and new research initiatives.
