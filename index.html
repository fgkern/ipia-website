      <h2>About IPIA</h2>
      <p>
        The International Politics in Africa (IPIA) research network is a group of scholars and practitioners
        engaged in the empirical study and understanding of how African societies, citizens, governments,
        supranational institutions, and non-governmental organisations experience international politics. On this
        website, you can learn more about our activities. Meet our members here.
      </p>
      <p>
        We meet regularly via our monthly virtual seminar, and at workshops and conferences around the globe.
        While the group is not institutionally affiliated, we work closely with institutional partners, such as
        the British Institute in Eastern Africa (BIEA), or CORN West Africa.
      </p>
      <p>
        Joining us is free. If you or your organisation are interested in becoming part of our community,
        please get in touch with us.
