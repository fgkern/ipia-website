      <h2>British Academy Writing Workshop on International Politics in Africa</h2>
      <p class="hero-intro">
        A British Academy–funded writing workshop that supports scholars working on the international politics of Africa,
        organised within the IPIA network.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Workshop overview -->
    <section class="about">
      <h2>Workshop Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The BA Writing Workshop on International Politics in Africa brings together a select group of academics to work
        intensively on draft papers, receive feedback from peers and journal editors, and take part in sessions designed
        to strengthen academic writing and research methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Participants prepare a paper for submission to a peer-reviewed journal and use the workshop process to refine
        their arguments, framing, and evidence. Thematically, the workshop focuses on international politics in Africa
        in a broad sense: how African societies, citizens, governments, regional and international organisations, and
        non-governmental actors experience and shape international politics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The workshop is generously funded by the British Academy and culminates in a three-day in-person meeting at the
        British Institute in Eastern Africa (BIEA) in Nairobi in April 2026.
      </p>
